# Todo-List-Appliaction

A to-do list project is a software project that develops a to-do list application. 
To-do list applications are used to track tasks that need to be completed. 
They typically allow users to create tasks, add due dates, set priorities, and add notes. Some to-do list applications also offer features such as reminders, synchronization, collaboration, and customization.
Task creation and management: To-do list apps allow you to create tasks, add due dates, set priorities, 
and add notes. You can also create subtasks, which can be helpful for breaking down larger tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks.

Reminders: To-do list apps can send you reminders for upcoming tasks, 
so you don't forget about them. You can set reminders for specific dates and times, or you can set them to recur at regular intervals.

Synchronization: To-do list apps can sync your tasks across multiple devices, 
so you can access them from anywhere. This is especially helpful if you use multiple devices throughout the day.

Collaboration: Some to-do list apps allow you to collaborate with others on tasks. 
This can be helpful if you're working on a project with a team or if you need to share your task list with someone else.

Customization: To-do list apps often offer a variety of customization options, 
so you can tailor the app to your specific needs. You can change the color scheme, the font, and the layout of your task list. You can also add tags to your tasks to help you organize them.
